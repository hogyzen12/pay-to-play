All codes will be sent out by the 31st.	Now you’ve filled in your email it’s time to claim your airdrop. Open up your Solana wallet and find your DH Hoodie or DH Tshirt tokens. Now send your tokens to:	MrchFrUf6zQqWpSKosEymtd1jDHjQC9RxxzbcCyqi4r. If you send 2 tokens - you will receive 2 codes, 4 tokens - 4 codes etc.. Each token corresponds to 1 merch airdrop. Once your transaction goes through look up the transaction on solscan and paste the link into the transaction link field. If you need to see how to do this check out the example videos below !! ',
